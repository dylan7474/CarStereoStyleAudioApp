# CarStereoStyleAudioApp

CarStereoStyleAudioApp is a lightweight web app that presents a car-stereo-inspired audio interface. It provides a retro dashboard-style layout for browsing and controlling audio playback with clear, tactile-style controls.

## Build on Linux

This project uses a Makefile to build the static assets.

```bash
make
```

## Basic Controls

- **Play/Pause**: Toggle playback for the current track.
- **Next/Previous**: Skip forward or backward through the playlist.
- **Volume**: Adjust the output level with the volume control.
- **Source**: Switch between available inputs or playlists.

## Roadmap

- Add a real playlist manager with drag-and-drop ordering.
- Support keyboard shortcuts for all primary controls.
- Theme presets to mimic different classic head units.
