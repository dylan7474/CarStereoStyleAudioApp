## Project Overview
- CarStereoStyleAudioApp is a static web UI for a car-stereo-style audio interface.
- The entry point is `index.html` with supporting assets alongside it.

## Workflow Tips
- Keep changes minimal and focused per request.
- Prefer semantic, descriptive text for user-facing content.
- When editing UI, check for layout regressions in common desktop widths.

## Testing
- There are no automated tests yet. Note this in your final response if none were run.

## Git Hygiene
- Use concise commit messages in present tense.
- Summarize changes and tests in the final response.
